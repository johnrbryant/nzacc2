"Permanent and long-term arrivals are people arriving for a stay of 12 months or more, including New Zealanders returning after an absence of 12 months or more."
"Permanent and long-term departures are New Zealanders departing for 12 months or more, and migrants leaving after a stay of 12 months or more in New Zealand."
"Actual series are counts derived from a sample of records from April 1975 to August 1997, and hence may contain sample error for these periods."
"Regions are territorial authority groupings that approximate regional council areas. Where territorial authorities span more than one regional council area, a territorial authority has been fully included in the region it is mainly in."
"New Zealand area data is not rebased when boundary changes occur. All data uses territorial authority boundaries which existed during the reference month."
